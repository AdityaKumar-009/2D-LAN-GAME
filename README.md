# 2D LAN GAME
 The proposed project is to develop a 2D LAN Multiplayer Shooting  game using the Unity3D game engine. The game will target a casual gaming audience and aim to provide engaging gameplay, vibrant visuals, and intuitive controls. The primary objective is to create an enjoyable and addictive gaming experience reminiscent of classic arcade shooters while incorporating modern game design principles. The game will feature random spawning locations and a variety of weapons that players can use strategically to eliminate their opponents. The focus is on creating an engaging and dynamic gaming experience for two or more players connected over a local area network (LAN).
